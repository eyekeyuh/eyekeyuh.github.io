        <h2>How much do you know about popular rock bands?</h2>
	<h1>Queen</h1>
	<p>The Band Queen is one of the most well-known bands of all time. Formed in 1970,
	the history of Queen begins with, one man, Freddie Mercury who, after seeing a local band play in a pub, approached them and asked to join, at the time the band had just split up, so the two remaining members declined, however, after hearing what Freddy had to offer, they decided they would take him eup on this offer, thus forming the start of the rock band we now know as Queen.</p>
	<p>Queen started out with:</p>
	<h3>Lead Singer, Freddy Mercury</h3>

	<h2>Bohemian Rhapsody </h2>
	<img src="bohemian rhapsody.jpg" alt="The Bohemian Rhapsody album cover" width="300">
	<p>Arguably, the best song ever written, Bohemian Rhapsody manages to capture every conceivable emotion, from heartbreak to shear joy. Bohemian Rhapsody acheives this quality through it's multiple segments, these include an, intro, a ballad, an operatic segment and a hard rock segment. These different segments provide us with different emotions as we experience the different genres that it provides. So what is Bohemian Rhapsody about? Well, Bohemian Rhapsody was written as a reference song, it talks about how much better Freddie Mercury's life could have been had he just been himself all of the time.</p>


	<h2>Don't Stop Me Now</h2> 
	<img src="dont stop me now.jpg" alt="" width="300">
	<p>Don't Stop Me Now is an extremely upbeat song. This makes it an extremely intriguing song though because when you actually did down and analise the lyrics, you realise that the story behind it isn't overly upbeat as it talks about a very worrying part of Freddy Mercury's life, a time where the band was very worried about Freddy and his actions.</p>
	<p>This song reflects that in some of his lyrics as Freddy felt "unstoppable". That being said, this song provides a person with an abundance of joy, it is very common to be belted out in the car on a roadtrip or at a wedding. really just anywhere where someone can truly enjoy themselves.</p>

	<h2>Crazy Little Thing Called Love</h2>
	<img src="queen the game.jpg" alt="" width="300">
	<p>Crazy Little Thing Called Love may be percieved as a love song written by Freddy, however it isn't necessarily a trivute to love or a "love song" it is rather a story, a story about Freddy Mercury's aversion to love. Throughout the lyrics we see examples of this very aversion, </p> 
	<p>"this thing called love</p>
	<p>I just can't handle it</p> 
	<p>this thing called love</p>
	<p>I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready</p>
	<p>Crazy little thing called love"</p>
	<p>Freddy sees it as an aspect of his life which he can not avoid, even to the point where he has a girlfriend that he does not love.</p>
