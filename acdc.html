        <h2>How much do you know about popular rock bands?</h2>
	<h1>AC/DC</h1>
	<p>AC/DC was formed in 1973 by Scottish-Australian brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. AC/DC is not only the most successful band to ever come out of Australia, it is also one of the most successful bands of all time.</p>
	<p>AC/DC started out with:</p>
	<h3>Vocalist, Bon Scott</h3>

	<h3>Lead Guitarist, Angus Young</h3>

	<h3>Rythm Guitarist, Malcolm Young</h3>

	<h3>Bassist, Cliff Williams</h3>

	<h3>Drummer, Phil Rudd</h3>

	<h2>Highway to Hell</h2>
	<img src="Highway to hell.jpg" alt="" width="300">
	<p>The "Highway to Hell" is actually a very real place. It was given as a nickname to the Canning Highway in Australia. It runs from Fremantle (Where Bon Scott lived) and ends at a bar called The Raffles.</p>
	<p>There is a large reflection of the road itself in the lyrics. As Canning Highway gets closer to the pub, there is a steep decline in the road: "No stop sign... speed limits... nobody gonna slow me down."</p>


	<h2>Back in Black</h2> 
	<img src="back in black.png" alt="" width="300">
	<p>Back in Black serves as a tribute song to Bon Scott. The band released it just five months after the tragic death of their lead singer.</p>
	<p>The entire Back in Black album was proof that although Bon Scott was gone, AC/DC could continue on without him, and they will.</p>

	<h2>Shoot to Thrill</h2>
	<img src="shoot to thrill.jpg" alt="" width="300">
	<p>This song has a predominantely sexual meaning, it explores a time in the bands life where the members would often enjoy that "rock and roll life".</p>
	<p>This song really just explores life how it was for the band, with lots of drugs and intercourse. They really were living the life they were talking about.</p>
