	<p>Lead guitarist Jimmy Page had just parted ways with his former band, The Yardbirds. After just leaving his band, Page was on the hunt for some new talent, and so he went searching. After some time, Page found Bassist and Keyboardist John Paul Jones, who, like Page, was a talented studio musician. As well as Jones, Plant found vocalist Robert Plant, and drummer John Bonham, both of whom came from small, little-known bands.</p>
	<p>Led Zeppelin started out with:</p>
	<h3>Lead singer, Robert Plant</h3>

	<h2>Going to California</h2>
	<img src="Led Zeppelin 4.jpg" alt="Led Zeppelin IV Album Cover" width="300">
	<p>Going to California is a tribute to the song writer/artist, Joni Mitchell, specifically, her song "california". In this song, a guy is looking for a girl just like her, one with "love in her eyes and flowers in her hair" who "plays guitar and sings." In Going to California, Plant plays the part of a guy who is looking to leave his woman behind and make a fresh start in California. </p>

	<h2>Immigrant Song</h2> 
	<img src="Led Zeppelin 3.png" alt="Led Zeppelin III Album Cover" width="300">
	<p>Immigrant Song is written about Iceland, it was written for Iceland when Led Zeppelin was invited by the Icelandic Government to perform at Reykjavik. It was made about their trip to Iceland and was the opening track to an album which would be drastically different to that song.</p>

	<h2>Black Dog</h2>
	<img src="Led Zeppelin 4 Deluxe.jpg" alt="Led Zeppelin IV (Deluxe Edition) Album Cover" width="300">
	<p>The title Black Dog actually has no correlation with the song. The band made the song at Headley Grange, a mansion in Hamphsire, England. A nameless balck labrador would often wonder the grounds of the mansion, and the band would often feed it. So when they came to naming this song and they couldn't figure out an obvious title, they thought of the dog and went with "Black Dog"</p>
	<p>In Black Dog, Robert Plant is singing about a woman who appeals to his interests, however, this woman is no good for him.</p>
